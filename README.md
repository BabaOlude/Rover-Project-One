# Rover-Project-One
Rover Project

The goal of this project writeup is to demonstrate the code used to solve the rover project:

I downloaded the simulator and recorded data in "Training Mode".
I tested out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided.
I added functions to detect obstacles and samples.
I demonstrated my mapping pipeline by filling in the process_image() function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw image to a map. 
I used moviepy to process the images in my saved dataset with the process_image() function. (See video below)

# Notebook Analysis

I ran the functions provided in the notebook on test images with the test data provided and with the test data I have recorded. I modified the functions to allow for color selection of obstacles.

I selected two images from training data I recorded, one for testing the color filter on ground, and the other for a rock
sample. To detect navigable areas, I used the default color threshold.

I populated the process_image() function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable
terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap. I also ran process_image() on my test data using the moviepy functions
provided to create video output of my results.

# Autonomous Navigation / Mapping

Autonomous Navigation and Mapping

Perception

I filled in the perception_step() function within the perception.py script with the appropriate image processing functions
to create a map and update Rover() data. I filled in the decision_step() function within the perception.py script with conditional statements. I iterated the perception and decision functions until acheiving navigation and mapping.

I the converted all three of the thresholded outputs (red, green, blue) into rover-centric coordinates. The navigable terrain
and wall coordinates were transformed to world coordinates. The basic steps led me to my highest fidelity. Rock sample coordinates were used to check if there is a sample in the image. If a sample was in sight, the rovers mode was set in the decision_step. If no rock sample is present the coordinates stayed in polor coordinates.

# Decision

In the decision_step function, I added a conditional check if the rover is currently picking up a sample, and if so to stop 
any movement and set the mode to 'stop'.

My approach worked and covers the environment with ~85 % fidelity. My rover successfully see and pickup rock samples.
